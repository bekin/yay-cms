How to install this Content Management Module in your Yii application

At first, we need to import the Database Schema. This is just one table
called 'sitecontent'. At the moment, only a Database dump of mysql is 
available.

Import the docs/schema_mysql.sql to the mysql Database that your Application
runs.

Extract the archive yaycms.zip into your protected/modules folder.

Add the module to your Application Configuration.
[...]
'modules' => array(
	'cms' => array(
	),
[...]

If you want to use the layout of your existing Web Application, set the layout
to an empty string: 

		'layout' => ''

Otherwise an easy default layout of the cms will be used.

Administrate your Content by using
http://app/index.php?r=cms/sitecontent/admin

or, when using a Route configuration, possibly

http://app/index.php/cms/sitecontent/admin

Please not that a 'sitecontent'-entry acts as a sitecontent as well as a
menu point.

In order to let your Application render the content at appropriate places,
do is like this:

// This will render a <ul><li>-based Menu containing all child elements of
// the menu points.
Cms::renderMenuPoints($menu_id); 

Also see the models/Cms.php for additional features.
